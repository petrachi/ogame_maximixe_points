# TODO

### Create

- shipping advisor

## improve

- add hyperspace tech for shipping space

- problem:
  - if we have amout od production == storage
  - then mine production will be at 0 cause it will not be able to stock
  - but storage production will be at 0 cause there is no lost production to stock
  - so none of these buildings will be recommended to build

  - i think there is something similar with energy
  - if energy_total == 0
  - cause mine production will be none if there is not enought energy (like crsital mine)
  - but energy production will be 0 too cause nothing demands more energy
  - (today, only metal mine icrease production when there is not energy, but it is a very small gain, so it seems a not very good investment)

- advisor
  - todo: calc shippings
  - todo: return shippings and recommended buildings
